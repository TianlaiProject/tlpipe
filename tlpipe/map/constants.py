"""Some constants used by the map makers.

This file defines a hierarchy of noise temperatures and are all based on
physical temperatures and noise levels.  This hierarchy is experiment dependant.

All temperatures in Kelvin.

These constants are defined here so other that modules (namely
time_stream.measure_noise) don't need to import dirty map to have access to
them.
