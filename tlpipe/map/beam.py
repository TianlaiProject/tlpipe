        This operation is equivalent to matrix multiplication by the beam

        matrix.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alg_ob: `vect` or `mat` subclass.
            Object to which the beam will be applied.  This object must live in
            map space.  If it is a vect, alg_ob.axes must be ('freq', 'ra',

            alg_ob.row_names() must return ('freq', 'ra', 'dec').  If
            `right_apply` is True, then alg_ob.col_names() should return

        right_apply: bool
            Whether to apply the beam operator with the from the left (False,
            default) or from the right (True).  If `alg_ob` is a vect subclass,
            this has no effect (because the beam matrix is symmetric).

        The missing feature here is the ability to preallocate memory or to be
        able to overwrite the input alg_ob in place.  This will be important

        Also this would be pretty easy to implement.

class GaussianBeam(Beam):

    This object inherits from the `Beam` object and gets much of its

    the beam of an instrument (which may be frequency dependent) and provides
    operations like the convolution of a map with the beam and matrix
    operations with the beam.

    This function fixes only the angular parts of the beam.  Along the
    frequency axis, the beam is assumed to be a top hat.  The frequency width
    of the beam is not fixed.  The width of the objects that the beam works
    with is assumed.  This reflects the fact that 21 cm experiments typically
    have essentially perfect frequency resolution and therefore the beam along
    the frequency axis is just a matter of binning.

    width: float or array
        The full width half max of the Gaussian beam.  If an array is provided,

        number for `width`.  Any units will work as long as you are consistent.
